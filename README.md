# Flatiron Module 3 Project
Our project for the Chicago Flatiron School's module 3 in the Data Science immersive program.

### Project Members
- Ahmed Safdar
- Bailey Bjornstad

## Project Description:
In this project, we aim to investigate relationships between air quality measurements available through the Environmental Protection Agency and incidences of chronic lung disease and death. The EPA Air Quality System contains multitudes of data on measurements of a variety of different compounds present in the air throughout the United States. We are interested in finding correlations as broken down accross geographical locations and by different potentially dangerous compounds in the air.

## Project Breakdown:
The project is divided into the following sections:
- [pyaqs.py](pyaqs.py): This is a custom module that handles wrapping and querying of the EPA Air Quality System API for ease of use with Python and Pandas.
- [data](./data/): This folder contains additional CSV and Excel files with data on instances and deaths from chronic lung disease and cancer.
- [cleaned_data](./cleaned_data/): This folder contains cleaned data files suitable for use in analysis.
- [cleaning_data.ipynb](cleaning_data.ipynb): This interactive notebook handles cleaning and preparation of the data.
- [data_analysis.ipynb](data_analysis.ipynb): This interactive technical notebook handles the analysis of prepared data, including automated hypothesis testing and visualizations.
- [visualizations_and_conclusions.ipynb](visualizations_and_conclusions.ipynb): This interactive notebook aimed at a non-technical audience contains visualizations and conclusions from our data analysis.
- [slides.pdf](slides.pdf): This slide deck contains a presentation on the material and results gathered here.
- [non_technical_notebook.ipynb](non_technical_notebook.ipynb): This is a non-technical notebook that gives a high-level overview of our project and again goes over visuualizations and conclusions.
